# Research: [System/Module Name]

## Overview

[What this system does in 2-3 sentences]

## Architecture

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `path/to/file.ts` | [Role] |

### Key Abstractions

[List the main classes, functions, or modules and what each is responsible for]

### Data Flow

[Trace how data moves through the system — entry point to storage/output]

## Existing Patterns

[Patterns that new code must respect: caching, error handling, naming conventions, ORM usage, etc.]

## Edge Cases & Invariants

[Implicit assumptions, ordering dependencies, things that break if violated]

## Findings

[Anything notable: bugs found, potential issues, undocumented behavior, technical debt]
